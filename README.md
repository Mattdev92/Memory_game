# Memory Game

Hi ! I've just made my first simple game project using React & Redux to practise Algorithmic Thinking in connection with Redux state managment.

Implemented solutions

 1. Cards displayded in grid view
 2. Timer solution for proper time measure
 3. Cards appear only on few seconds
 4. Same two cards clicked one after another will not dissapear - it'Å› prefect match
 5. Every pair of card will end the game and stop timer
 
## How it works
